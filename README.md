Combining the best of Instagram and Yelp.

To run, you must pip install python-instagram, be logged into an Instagram account on Instagram.com, and click verify on the home page.


<b>DISCLAIMER</b> We created InstaYelpFoodPorn with the noble goal of providing the best food pictures Instagram has to offer. Unfortunately, the internet is not a nice place. As a result, not all the pictures InstaYelp picks up is food related. Tread carefully - you have been warned.
